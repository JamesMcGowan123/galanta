The known information on the player characters will be placed here and updated as regularly as I can. This is a section I do encourage people try and contribute to for their own characters, but once again it is not mandatory.

What I desire and expect from a character background page, either for this site or for me to see as the DM, includes the information below. It does not have to be in this format or order as long as the information is there, though I do suggest the format be loosely followed so that I can figure out where everything is easily. Furthermore, not all the information is mandatory. The things I do need to know will be marked with an asterisk, and those that are not are either already known (such as the Player Name) or are optional for you as the player to choose to include. If the heading has an asterisk, questions within it are required.

Also given is an example of a character written using this format. You can use that as an example, or ask me any questions on any sections that you may not understand. I am always happy to help.

### Quick Facts:
- Player Name:
- Character Name*:
- Character Age*:
- Class*:
- Species*:
- Gender Identification/Pronouns*:
- Character Sexuality?*:

#### Goals*:
A lot of this is paraphrased from the fantastic book: [The Game Master’s Handbook of Proactive Roleplaying](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Game-Masters-Handbook-Proactive-Roleplaying/dp/1956403442), which goes into far more detail and is a very good resource for players.

###### You should not come up with your goals on your own, so it is okay if these are not filled to the brim at the start of the campaign without anyone else's help. These will be a discussion between us to find goals that are fun, have interesting narrative or mechanical consequences, and are interesting for you to play.

##### Players should have Multiple Goals
This is what your character wishes to accomplish within the campaign. Though one goal is good, it would be better to have 3 or 4 goals to ensure that each session has at least one motivating force. These goals can and should be connected (a character wanting to defeat an ancient evil must gather information to know the weaknesses of such evil, gather an army to help fight against the evil, and discover the lair of this villain) but should involve different things, allowing for different paths a player can take if one quest needs to be put on hold (perhaps allies are far from the character's current location, the player can start gathering information as they approach the army needed).

If a character insists on doing one thing only, it is easy for them and the party to get stuck in a one-sided and much more rigid narrative. Having a varied number of goals means there will always be something to do. Having multiple varied goals within one overarching narrative makes the game easier for me to run and easier for all of us to have a good time, as we won't be waiting or twiddling our thumbs with nothing to do.

A player should aim for 3 to 4 goals that should be replaced either immediately or after a few sessions so that they (and you) can think of what to do next.

##### Goals should be achievable
These goals should achievable, meaning measurable and specific. The goal "I want to become more powerful" is too vague to be understood well, whereas the goal "I want to win in a real duel against an opponent who is much stronger than me" expresses the same desire but has a much clearer finish line. There could even be variations, such as "I wish to defeat Gudrick Moonbearer, Leader of the Fang of Fenrir in one on one combat" or "I wish to become the champion of the Infernal Tournament" to add intrigue and more specific plotlines.

##### Goals should have a chance for failure
A goal should also have consequences for failure. Failure is an interest narrative element that changes us and the character. If a character accomplishes a goal, we'll reassess, adjust the world, and formulate new goals. The same should happen if you were to fail a goal. In this case, there will be a penalty, the world will be adjusted, and new goals will be formed. These penalties do not have to be mechanical, and in fact I prefer more narrative oriented failures. Did you fail to defeat the ancient evil? Their influence spreads and you must now deal with the aftermath. Did you fail to uncover the identity of a killer? They strike again, and this time a victim is a friend or loved one. Penalties should be personal, as this drives the plot forward. These consequences don't need to be explicitly baked into the goal beforehand, but you should have a good idea of what you'll face if you fail.
	For example, failing to uncover the full incantation of a spell might mean it misfires (or even backfires). However, failing to convince a human settlement that a horde of Gnolls is on the way shouldn't mean the Gnolls automatically wipe out the settlement, but does mean you should understand that the settlement will be ill equipped to deal with the raid and be more deadly.

Finally, a character goal does not have sufficient consequences for failure if they can be reattempted. If you can fail at achieving a goal only to try again, then there are no consequences to failing. If your only penalty for not being able to open a door (to achieve the mid-term goal of "uncover the secret artefact allowing me to harm the ancient evil") is that you must try again, then it shouldn't be a player goal, it should be a skill check.

##### Goals should be fun
Generally these should be fun to pursue at the levels you are at the moment of creation. If you are playing a third level wizard, it may be a good long-term goal to pursue lichdom, but it definitely will not be fun for a while - you'll need to focus on other things first. Alternatively, a level 20 fighter choosing to hunt a low threat monster will find it trivially easy and also not fun. Introducing mid-term or short-term goals, such as progressive mastery of necromancy for the wizard or a higher threat or obstacle between the goal of the fighter will transform the goal into something more fun without replacing it.

###### If you find that a goal is not fun whilst playing it, don't be afraid to let me know so that we can discuss ways to make it more enjoyable and fun for you to play.

##### Goals should have varying time frames
I implore you to think of goals as short-term, mid-term, and long-term. This variety of scales helps me direct your focus on one thing, with occasional detours towards secondary goals, and helps prioritise them in a way that feels more organic (because... it is). A good spread is one mid-term or long-term goal, then one or two short-term goals towards that mid-term or long-term goal.

###### Short Term*
A short term goal can be completed in just a few sessions, and should be doable at the current level of the player character.

###### Mid-Term*
A mid term goal takes some time to complete and may not be possible at the current level without gaining power, skills, or hard-to-find information.

###### Long-Term*
These are the primary objectives of campaign or character arcs. These can be as cosmic as "Ascend to Godhood" or as personal as "Fulfil my vengeance".

### Appearance*:
This is a section for your character's appearance; how they look, how they present themselves, what they carry, all will be in this section.

### Personality:
This is your character's personality. How they act, what they love, what they fear. This can be formatted using the D&D 5e's Traits, Bonds, Flaws, and Ideals system, but this is more so for you to look back on if you are feeling unsure about how your character would act in certain situations. As such these are not vital for you to write, but still suggested

### Character History (please limit to max ten paragraphs, bulleted lists are also fine)*
What your character has been doing to lead them up to this moment. From their early life all the way to current day, this allows the DM to understand your character and introduce hooks to their life that you as a player might be interested in. This can include such questions as:
- What does your character do for work?
- Where do they live, and under what conditions?:
- Where did they learn their skills?

- Who are your parents? Names, ages, marital status:
- What do they do for work?:
- Are they both alive? (If not, please say how/when they died):
- Do you have siblings? What are their names and ages?:
- What is your relationship with your parents?:

- What is your relationship with your siblings?:
- What is your family’s poverty level (ex. rich, poor, middle class, etc):

#### NPCs*:
Included in your family history, this gives me more information on the people in your past, and why they are important to you. Very good information for the DM to have.

- Besides family, are there any NPCs that are important to your life? Friends? Enemies? Please name 1-3 with brief descriptions of appearance, in-game race, and personality/relationship to you:
- Do you have a rival?:
- Have you had any major love interests? Any current ones?:
