[line-3, body-2]
+ Pre-SCI</br> ??? Years Ago
+ First Chaos Insurgency
+ It is unknown why the first Chaos Insurgency took place, considering the battle started before the planets land formed. Before then, the two brothers, Limund and Providence, fought in a vicious battle with their armies. This duel broke through the great void of the universe, splintering and cracking the veil of darkness to form stars.
At the pinnacle of this war, the armies fell on the celestial bodies littered around the universe, with the corpse of a deity named Galánta upon this planet to form the land.
It was also at this time that Providence prevailed, banishing Limund’s body upon the pale moon that orbits furthest from the planet of Galánta. This banishment was so profound and intense that the moon ruptured into segments, forcing Providence to keep them together by growing a tree in the core of Limund’s prison, the branches extending and latching onto the broken pieces.

> 	-   This tree was not able to retain all the pieces, and so parts of the lunar body scattered upon Galánta cursed with Limund’s power.
> -   Providence sits upon the rusted moon closer to Galánta’s body to protect the life that has grown on the planet during this battle.

+ Second Chaos Insurgency
+ Aw shit, here we go again
The pieces of Limunds’ moon that scattered upon Galánta’s surface had evolved, corrupting the creatures of the world and enticing them with intelligence far beyond what the norm of the time. These creatures went on murderous rampages, slaughtering those that were not burdened with this power and marring the land. To this day, there are still pieces of land scarred by the power of Limund’s corruption.

Providence, as a means to combat those that mean to destroy what he loves, gave divinity to the select few creatures that had faced this corruption and resisted its allure. This gift birthed the Údará, who went on to grant sentience to creatures to create an army large enough to fight against Limund’s forces, bringing in the existence of the Tír Dhúchais and Arkhibiil. Some people say this happened in Relair, the capital of Tír Dhúchais, whilst others believe this occurred in the center of the Cerulean Depths, causing the rift between the lands.

The forces fought together against Limund’s Army, scarring the terrain into what would slowly become the Roaming Badlands. Slowly but surely, the Údará, with the help of the forces of man, fought the forces of Limund back into the Void, preventing their scheme to bring back the Outer God.

Sealed again, those that had died in this Chaos Insurgency had joined Providences’ protection of the world on the red moon, gaining the name of the Rusted Soldiers.

+ The Abstraction
+  With the danger that magic poses outside of that ordained by the Abbot of the Stars, a danger that seems more and more prevalent with the mastications (the official term for the string of murders in which the bodies were contorted and twisted to wring the blood from their body) the warlock Xonim committed, sorcerers were unjustly blamed for many problems [[Galánta/Makoni/Keysal/Kingdom of Tír Dhúchais/Countries (Dhúchais)/Keyni Fields/Relair/Relair]] was facing.
Soon, the Abbot called for a hunt, culling the Sorcerers of Dhúchais out to prevent any more murders from happening. They were all killed, a portion of them escaping via the ocean or via the [[Roaming Badlands]] (or even through the [[Galánta/Makoni/Keysal/Kingdom of Tír Dhúchais/Countries (Dhúchais)/Rikebo Sierra/Rikebo Sierra]]).

+ 17th century
+ Europe and coffee
+ In 1616, the Dutch founded the first European-owned coffee estate in Sri Lanka, then Ceylon, then Java in 1696. The French began growing coffee in the Caribbean, followed by the Spanish in Central America and the Portuguese in Brazil. European coffee houses sprang up in Italy and later France, where they reached a new level of popularity. Now, it is de _rigueur_ for Parisians to indulge in a cup of coffee and a baguette or croissant at the numerous coffee cafes throughout Paris.
