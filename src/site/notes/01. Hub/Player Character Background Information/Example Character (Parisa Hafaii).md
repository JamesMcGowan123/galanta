### Appearance:
![Parisa Avatar.png|left](/img/user/z_attachments/Parisa%20Avatar.png) 

Parisa is a boar-like shifter with chestnut eyes, their porcine fangs jutting out the sides of their mouth and curving back towards the back of their skull, poking underneath his off-white hair. Their clothes, a deep green (#092E0C) layered leather, is buckled by a simple belt that portrays different fungi of a lilac rose colouring at equal distances from one another. This design carries on underneath two sheathed short swords, both of which have a root brew (#2E0C04) brown handle with a blue (#55F2DA) cross-guard that curve to represent wind. On each, the pommel is a craftsman brown (#AD9278) hand holding a deep black orb. The hand seems to be missing a finger, the same finger on each side, its ring finger. The cloak, a blacklist-like (#220D2E) colour , is clasped by two golden birch leaves with a lindworm green (#1E2E09) undertone.

### Biography:
#### Early Life:

Born to a disgraced nobleman Gael Bahar and their hunter wife Millicent, Parisa spent much time outside his dwindling estate. He felt more at home in the wilds outside [[Waterdeep\|Waterdeep]], a fact that did little to help the restoration of his people’s honour (according to his father). His mother felt it necessary for him to explore his own interests, but his father was not having any of it. “We must be better so that people will once again respect us.” They divorced shortly, with Parisa staying with his father. Parisa had not seen his mother since. He was 8 at this time.

Parisa learnt the ways of a nobleman, taking up the Viol at 15 as a hobby that his father would be proud of. It worked, and along with his studies, more and more neighbouring nobles took interest in him as a potential suitor. Gael, however, thought his family better than those around him. Though he wished for agreements, he would not give away his heir to that lower than him. He had Parisa stick to his studies, not allowing for him to socialise with those around him unless to perform his Viol, or to flaunt his son’s intellectual capabilities.

When a foreign dignitary of a far off court had come to hear Parisa’s music, Gael was sceptical. However, this mysterious stranger’s proof won Parisa’s father over; the amount of gold that day was more than the two had ever seen. Parisa had proved his abilities to be more than a rumour, and his father was offered a deal: “Have your son join my court, and you will be as wealthy and influential as a king until you draw your last breath.”. Gael had taken the deal. Only then was it revealed that this was a member of the Summer Court of the Feywild, a fact that did not seem to bother Parisa or his father, not knowing of the true strength of their words.

#### Mid-Life:

Throughout their time through the Feywild, Parisa had learnt many things. His skills with a Viol were important, yes. His understanding of the wild however, parted down from his mother, made his acclimation all the more possible. Many creatures throughout were excited to hear tales of critters and creatures of the Material Plane’s wild, and those of a more powerful nature simply enjoyed his abilities to tell stories. In turn, Parisa was a good guest of the Summer Court. He had been introduced to the political schemes of the court, a skill that he did his best to wrap his head around. Eventually he was able to understand their inane rules, though after months had passed he wondered at his true station here. He had not heard of his parents, or the rest of his family, whilst he stayed in the Feywild. It was a subject dismissed with the wave of a hand, until Parisa tried to find out.  

After an escape attempt had gone awry, he had learnt the truth. In his severe punishment, he was told of his position, told of the truth behind his father’s agreement with the Summer Court. He was a dancing bear. He was to take care of the children, to tell stories. When they say jump, he asks how high. Initially, he resisted this. Why would he make a mockery of himself?! He is a sentient being, not some puppet to be tossed around for their amusement! However, days in captivity turned to months, and he had asked himself: “What is the difference between now and when they were with their father?” In fact, these people treated them better, from their memories. They had free access to go as he pleased, they were given guards for protection, allowed to eat and drink as he pleased. All Parisa had to do was play the Viol, something he enjoyed, regale the children with stories of his youth. He was losing out by being indignant, by acting out against the Fae! Soon, he joined back the Court, with even more appreciation for the chance he has been given!

#### Recently:

In one of his stories, Parisa had spotted an absolute beauty of a Satyr. Their fur was pristine, their hair filled to the brim with flowers, the freckles upon their features that only complimented their dark inflection. Parisa was smitten, but it could never be, for he was not a true member of the Summer Court. Parisa had asked for a way to prove himself, to return to his home of Waterdeep so that he may return with a gift, a gesture so grand, that he may find his way into the Court and be with his love! They had acquiesced, returning him to the Material Plane on this quest. As a trick, however, and to prove his inability to truly be one of them, he had been sent years after his time, in front of his old home: A defunct and decrepit home.

### Relationships:

#### Tuatha:

Tuatha is the archfey that had brought Parisa to the Seelie Court. Their skin is incredibly dark, save for the explosive tear-like gold that extends from their golden eyes, broken occasionally by black cracks across the surface. Their hair is black, with specks of white that don’t move as the hair does, as though reflecting a still starscape. The hair hides a white diadem that juts out in intervals, like fingers reaching out from below the hair’s surface. Their clothing is stark white, save for the little splotches of green that litter their clothing, a sign of their allegiance to the Seelie Court. They seem to be missing their ring finger on each hand.

They seem very intrigued by Parisa’s skills, and will always deny any pleasure taken in imprisoning the shifter.

#### V:
V was their main guard in the Feywild, and the creature that had joined Parisa to the Material, to make sure he did not escape or go back on his promise for a gift. V is a [Water Genasi](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/lineage:genasi-water). Their hair is a sleek waterfall, bushing up into a white froth at the base of their spine. Their body seems perpetually filled with bubbles, and their face is long and pointed. As their mouth opens, you’d see a second mouth that would snap forward when the primary mouth opened too much. Their clothes are dark green that look as though they grew off the body of V is scrutinised.

#### Deirbhile:
Deirbhile (D-EH-ra-va-la) is the one that had caught Parisa’s fancy. She is a dark-skinned Satyr with bright freckles littered upon her body. Her leg fur is not fur at all, but instead moss. Moss covered in fungus and lichen that stretches to reach her hair, kelp and seaweed tied in a bunch. Her guide cane is a thick wooden cane with vines along the sides. Contrary to her elegant appearance, she was a brash and loud woman, boisterous in her actions and words except when Parisa told his stories. She seemed to like them, and he grew in love with her personality.

#### Gael:
Gael Bahar, father of Parisa, is a desperate man. A man engulfed by their greed, their voracious avarice led him to sell his own son to Tuatha. He is a wiry man, who looks as though they had chosen a moustache over a mouth. As Parisa knew him, he had refused a cane even when he had needed it, not wishing to be seen as less of a person for accepting help. Those who knew him after Parisa had left would note two extra fingers on their hands, both incredibly dark unlike Gael’s.
