## Ability Checks

### Critical Success and Failure
A natural 20 on the die will produce the best result the character's skill and circumstances reasonably could. Likewise, a natural 1 on the die will produce the worst. Your master thief will not fall on her ass 5% of the time she tries to open a window, but neither will an incredible stealth check render her invisible. Ability checks will only be called for in ordinary circumstances if there is a reasonable chance of failure.

### Skill Challenges
A skill challenge is used when the PCs are attempting something complicated that requires multiple steps and multiple contributors. Tasks like persuading a noble, fortifying a ruin, winning a court case, searching the wilderness, tracking down a criminal, escaping from prison, crafting a magic item, climbing a mountain, or figuring out a complicated clockwork machine. Players propose a skill they would like to use to address the challenge, and the DM will set a DC. For each successive time the same skill is used by the party, the difficulty increases by 5. Expending limited resources will usually improve the chances of success. The skill challenge ends when the players accumulate a set number of success, or three failures, whichever comes first.

### Alternative Ability Score Checks
You may be asked to use another base modifier (i.e. strength) for a skill check (i.e. persuasion or intimidation). You would simply add your proficiency modifier (if you are proficient in the skill check) to the new base modifier. You can also ask if you can switch the base modifier, and depending on the task it may be allowed.

### Skill Dogpiling
In most circumstances, no more than two PCs should attempt a given check, or one with assistance. Knowledge checks are frequently an exception to this rule.

### Taking 10
If a character is not in a stressful situation (such as a conflict or high-stakes situation) they can make ability and skill checks without rolling a d20. Instead, they “take 10”, calculating their result as if they had rolled 10 on the d20. If taking 10 wouldn’t be high enough to complete the task, they can roll a d20 instead. Taking 10 represents a character’s default aptitude at a task, when not under pressure. The PHB has a similar rule called “Passive Checks” on p.175.

### Taking 20
If a character has ten times as much time available as a task would normally take, and has the ability to try multiple different solutions (such as using ad-hoc tools, looking up information in a book, or coordinating a plan with others), they can “take 20” instead of rolling a d20. This represents a character’s aptitude in the best of circumstances. The DMG has a similar rule on p.237: “Multiple Ability Checks”.

## Character Creation

### 2014/2024 Classes
You can choose between 2014 or 2024 classes to use, we will not be holding ourselves strictly to one or the other.

### Homebrew
If there is a character concept you are interested in but is not supported, bring it to my attention and we can work together to reflavour an existing option or homebrew something from whole cloth. I will usually work to find a 3<sup>rd</sup> Party option that works for both of us, as well.

### 3<sup>rd</sup> Party Material
I allow many if not all sources of 3<sup>rd</sup> Party Material, as long as I am consulted on it first. I will focus on the narrative elements of the world, so if something seems to broken or seems to break the world I will try and find an alternative that works for both of us. There are some homebrew materials that are confirmed allowed, which will be found in the Homebrew section of this page.

### Feats
Similar to the variant Human in the PHB, non- human races can also gain a feat at level 1. If they choose to gain a feat, all ability score improvements are replaced with a single +1 increase in an ability of their choice.

### PC Secrets
Players are welcome to keep secrets from one another, but I recommend sharing them with at least one or two other players. It’s much easier to have meaningful interactions with other characters that tie thematically to your secrets and motivate character growth if at least one other player can be a co-conspirator in your secret.

### Creation Stats
You do not have to choose a specific way to generate ability scores. If you choose to roll, you can reroll your ability scores if the total is under 72 if you wish. This is not to discourage low stats in a character, as low stats can enable you to tell a story just as much as high stats. A great character has flaws, and embracing those flaws will encourage an interesting narrative.

### Levelling
When levelling a character, if you roll 1 for HP you are allowed to reroll.

### Creation at Higher Levels
When creating a new character, consult this table (focusing on the High Magic Campaign column).

## Combat
### Cleaving and Piercing
When you kill an enemy with a weapon attack, any excess damage can be applied to another creature within reach (who has an AC equal to or below the initial attack). Two changes are made to the Cleave rules on p.272 of the DMG:
- You don’t need to take a creature from full HP to 0 HP in one hit in order to cleave. Any excess damage can cleave.
- Ranged weapon attacks can “pierce”: any excess damage can be applied to a creature within 5 feet of the target in a straight line from where you attacked. This rule allows martial characters to more easily handle multiple foes, something that is otherwise mostly limited to spellcasters.

### Bonus Actions
Any effect that can be produced with a bonus action may also be produced with an action.

### Potions
Drinking a potion takes a bonus action unless you are using it to heal another person, in which case it’s an action.

### Casting Spells
Instead of being able to cast only a cantrip in addition to a levelled spell, you can cast a spell of 3rd or higher and a spell of 2nd or lower on the same turn.

### Initiative
Any player may voluntarily lower their initiative at the beginning of combat, after seeing the rolls of their allies.

### Items
Any item that requires you to say a command word, and does not specify the requirement for saying the command word (action, bonus action, reaction, etc.) requires a bonus action.

### Improved Drawing and Stowing:
- You can draw weapons or handheld objects as part of the same action in which you use them, provided you have a free hand (or hands, if more than one hand is needed to hold the weapons or objects) before taking the action.
- Similarly, you can pick up a loose unattended object within your reach and use it as part of an action.
- Once per turn, you can stow any or all of the weapons or objects you’re holding in your hand (no action required).
- You can drop any or all objects you’re holding as a reaction.

### Divine Intervention
I'm gonna homebrew something kind of with Divine Intervention (to a maximum of 5) each pet image will increase the upper limit of the Divine Intervention by 1. They have to be unique images, though not necessarily new.

### Weaponry
Weaponry will be using the properties of the Warrior's Codex, found in the Homebrew section of the page.

### Martials
Martial classes, including:
- Barbarian
- Blood Hunter
- Fighter
- Monk
- Ranger
- Rogue

Can choose Martial Exploits from the book titled Martial Exploits (found in the Homebrew Section) following the spells progression of half casters. 

For example, a 3rd level Monk would know 3 Martial Exploits, and can choose 3 first level exploits. When going up to 5th Level, the Monk can replace those 3 first level exploits to gain 4 exploits of either first or second level. The number of times a person can use an exploit are still using the rules of the book Martial Exploits.

## Death and Resurrection

### The Fading Soul:
Character death can often prove to become a minor inconvenience in some campaigns once the adventuring party reaches a certain level, with spells being available to return fallen comrades from the afterlife with temporary setbacks, robbing a small element of danger, and threat to future conflicts and challenges within the story. If you wish to elevate the gravity of character death, you can introduce this optional rule.

If a character is dead, and a resurrection is attempted by a spell or spell effect with longer than a 1 action casting time, a Resurrection Challenge is initiated. Up to 3 members of the adventuring party can offer to contribute to the ritual via a Contribution Skill Check. The DM asks them each to make a skill check based on their form of contribution, with the DC of the check adjusting to how helpful/impactful the DM feels the contribution would be.

For example, praying to the god of the devout, fallen character may require an Intelligence (Religion) check at an easy to medium difficulty, where loudly demanding the soul of the fallen to return from the aether may require a Charisma (Intimidation) check at a very hard or nearly impossible difficulty. Advantage and disadvantage can apply here based on how perfect, or off base, the contribution offered is.

After all contributions are completed, the DM then rolls a single, final Resurrection success check with no modifier. For each successful contribution skill check, this DC is decreased by 3, whereas each failed contribution skill check increases the DC by 1.

Upon a successful resurrection check, the player’s soul (should it be willing) will be returned to the body, and the ritual succeeded. On a failed check, the soul does not return and the character is lost.

Only the strongest of magical incantations can bypass this resurrection challenge, in the form of the True Resurrection or Wish spells. These spells can also restore a character to life who was lost due to a failed resurrection ritual.

If a spell with a casting time of 1 action is used to attempt to restore life (via the Revivify spell or similar effects), no check is required, but 

### Poisoned Condition
The Poisoned Condition gives Disadvantage to Death Saving Throws.

### Resurrection Consequences:
