- Instead of being able to cast only a cantrip in addition to a levelled spell, you can cast a spell of 3rd or higher and a spell of 2nd or lower on the same turn.

- Drinking a potion takes a bonus action unless you are using it to heal another person, in which case it’s an action.

- When levelling up -- if you roll a 1 for HP, reroll. You must take the new roll.

- Skill checks during combat are free to attempt, but may require your action or bonus action at the DM's discretion, should you succeed.

- If you roll worse than your bonus in a passive skill (perception, insight, investigation) you can use your passive skill instead at the cost of a higher DC.

- For people that do not use distinct accents or voices to differentiate what is in character and what isn’t, do your best to make it clear whether you will be speaking in character.
	- “_____ will say…” 
	- Statements in character voice are, unless specified, in character.

- When a character is resurrected, [roll from this table.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mm1JGkPzps6BVlMxEaUsWrH72NQJNuAyvlfQCRKRwSQ/edit#gid=0) 
- You may be asked to use another base modifier (i.e. strength) for a skill check (i.e. persuasion or intimidation). You would simply add your proficiency modifier (if you are proficient in the skill check) to the new base modifier. You can also ask if you can switch the base modifier, and depending on the task it may be allowed.


### Improved Two Weapon Fighting:
- Once on your turn when you take the Attack action and attack with a melee weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can make one additional attack with a different melee weapon that you’re holding in the other hand as part of the same action. If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it. A character’s ability score modifier is added to the damage roll of the extra attack. You can use two-weapon fighting even when the one-handed melee weapons you are wielding aren’t light.

### Improved Drawing and Stowing:
- You can draw weapons or handheld objects as part of the same action in which you use them, provided you have a free hand (or hands, if more than one hand is needed to hold the weapons or objects) before taking the action.
- Similarly, you can pick up a loose unattended object within your reach and use it as part of an action.
- Once per turn, you can stow any or all of the weapons or objects you’re holding in your hand (no action required).
- You can drop any or all objects you’re holding as a reaction.

  

- Any item that requires you to say a command word, and does not specify the requirement for saying the command word (action, bonus action, reaction, etc.) requires a bonus action  

- I'm gonna homebrew something kind of with Divine Intervention (to a maximum of 5) each pet image will increase the upper limit of the Divine Intervention by 1. They have to be unique images, though not necessarily new.
 

- Rather than using usual proficiencies, we will be using additional rules to give the proficiencies some more oomph. They can be found here: [Tool Proficiencies: RELOADED](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rzh9Ni_DJXsLCNq2OZR1gU6aQkuEFUOiti-ZFtSK4Fo/edit?usp=sharing)

### The Fading Soul:
Character death can often prove to become a minor inconvenience in some campaigns once the adventuring party reaches a certain level, with spells being available to return fallen comrades from the afterlife with temporary setbacks, robbing a small element of danger, and threat to future conflicts and challenges within the story. If you wish to elevate the gravity of character death, you can introduce this optional rule.

If a character is dead, and a resurrection is attempted by a spell or spell effect with longer than a 1 action casting time, a Resurrection Challenge is initiated. Up to 3 members of the adventuring party can offer to contribute to the ritual via a Contribution Skill Check. The DM asks them each to make a skill check based on their form of contribution, with the DC of the check adjusting to how helpful/impactful the DM feels the contribution would be.

For example, praying to the god of the devout, fallen character may require an Intelligence (Religion) check at an easy to medium difficulty, where loudly demanding the soul of the fallen to return from the aether may require a Charisma (Intimidation) check at a very hard or nearly impossible difficulty. Advantage and disadvantage can apply here based on how perfect, or off base, the contribution offered is.

After all contributions are completed, the DM then rolls a single, final Resurrection success check with no modifier. For each successful contribution skill check, this DC is decreased by 3, whereas each failed contribution skill check increases the DC by 1.

Upon a successful resurrection check, the player’s soul (should it be willing) will be returned to the body, and the ritual succeeded. On a failed check, the soul does not return and the character is lost.

Only the strongest of magical incantations can bypass this resurrection challenge, in the form of the True Resurrection or Wish spells. These spells can also restore a character to life who was lost due to a failed resurrection ritual.

If a spell with a casting time of 1 action is used to attempt to restore life (via the Revivify spell or similar effects), no contribution skill checks are allowed. The character casting the spell makes a Rapid Resurrection check, rolling a d20 and adding their spellcasting ability modifier. The DC increases by 1 for each previous successful resurrection the character has undergone. On a failure, the character’s soul is not lost, but the resurrection fails and increases any future Resurrection checks’ DC by 1. No further attempts can be made to restore this character to life until a resurrection spell with a casting time higher than 1 action is attempted.

- The Poisoned Condition gives Disadvantage to Death Saving Throws.

- If you are creating a new character at a different level, consult this table in regards to equipment (Focusing on the High Magic Campaign section):
