# Gal√°nta:
This is not an idyllic world, without pain or strife. But it is a world where people try their best to make it known that whenever hardships are faced, they are not faced alone. This is a beautiful land, full of life and soul. A land filled with communities, both small and large, separated by vast stretches of the unknown, and connected by dirt paths, waterways, and the rare airship.

This is a world of butterfly wings and tornadoes, where even the smallest acts of kindness or malice can cascade into ruin and hope. The most important thing to me, however, is that this is a world unfinished. It is my hope that we will continue to weave this tapestry with passion.

## Expectations
These are the expectations I have for you as a player in my game. These are my ideal expectations for players at my table so that I can enjoy my experience as a DM, and I can tailor an experience meant to be enjoyed by everyone at the table.

### Game Expectations:
These are expectations laid out for the players to understand the state of the game. The most important thing to remember is that these are all a discussion, and to not fret if you wish to not participate should those discussions not go your way. I understand it is a commitment, and with time as a constant variable in our lives I would only ask you to stay if you think this is something you find enjoyable and interesting. I thank the time you have spent reading this, and the interest you have shown so far.

#### Time
We play on Saturdays every other week, from 5PM to 9PM GMT. This is subject to change depending on the circumstances and availability. The expected length of play is 4 hours. We stick to this rule somewhat closely, though it may end later. If the length of a session does indeed go over the allotted time, you are free to go.

#### Homebrew:
This world, this game, is heavily homebrewed. From homebrew rules to entire classes, I would love to work with you on an idea that does not fit the conventional and given rules of D&D. If this is of interest to you, I would need you to know that you must take the helm on an idea pertaining to your character. I will give as much help as I can and advise as best as I can, but it would be you that would have to come to me, and would have the final say of what happens with your character.

You can check all the Houserules, including what Homebrew we use, at [[01. Hub/Houserules\|Houserules]].

#### Decorum:
Be cordial and respectful of those joining us at the table, and especially be patient if there is a story beat that does not focus on your character or a player needs clarification on the rules. We are all working together to tell a story, the journey IS the destination, and it will be more enjoyable if we let people have their moments.

#### Type of Story (and Proactivity):
A big draw to DMing is facilitating a story driven by the players, and their characters. My interest lies in having the player character‚Äôs goals be the driving force of the campaign, rather than asking the players to simply wait for a large evil organisation to act so that you can stop their dastardly plans. It will be your short, mid, and long term goals that push the party forward. This does mean that your backstory is vital to this story, and constant communication is necessary to help facilitate your ideals. This does mean that the story is bound to be more non-linear, as the story will follow your choices.

#### Style of Play:
I have little interest in combat that is not narratively satisfying. This may mean that we go more than 10 sessions without actual combat, if it does not make sense or does not pull the story forward. I find social interaction and exploration to be much more compelling pillars of play, and hope to focus more on those. Of course, this does not mean there will be no combat at all, simply that there will be much less than what some may hope for.

### Player Expectations

#### Attentiveness:
I want people to have information ready, or at least available to them if they need it, without requiring me to reiterate too many times. Once or twice is fine, but please do not make it a habit not to listen or pay attention. pausing the game is more than preferred if you need time to jot something down.

  

#### Engagement:
I want people to respond when I call for them, even if just to show that they‚Äôve been paying attention. It is very disheartening to hear people ask for a recap of what has been happening, especially if it would concern their character.

  

#### Character Understanding:
Of course, the application of knowledge is more important than the storage of it. However, not knowing what to do when your turn in combat comes up really slows down the pace of the fight. For this, I recommend a resource Amanda shared a while back called the Turn Manager ([Example Turn Manager - MAKE A COPY](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WrUAzfCLChf96LxP1RFZZ3JE1-4MhE_sAiX-XUHNkvM/edit#gid=0)). This also goes for backstory; not knowing a character when they are integral, or at least important information your character would be interested in, feels as though you are not paying attention to the story and do not actually care about the time being put into this campaign.

  

#### Honesty:
If there is a situation where you do not wish to say something for ‚Äúfear of taking us out of the game‚Äù, I would rather you say it than wait until it festers into burnout. This also goes for things that you would want in the campaign. If, later down the line, you want something to happen to your character (or for your character to get an item or change class), tell me about it! I am all for hearing your ideas and finding a point that would be fun for all of us. Yes, this is a story, but it is more importantly a game for us to have fun and enjoy each other‚Äôs company!

For the former situations (situations that are uncomfortable for you to sit through or hear), there is a built-in Safety Tools function in FoundryVTT. Simply click the tophat on the left of the screen to access it.

This also leads to our next point

#### Forms to fill:
It is vitally important you fill out the MCDM Tabletop Safety checklist (so that I know what to avoid as the writer) and Character History Sheet (so that I know what is important to you and your character). Both sheets are listed above. The Character History Sheet does not have to be the exact same, some of you have submitted similar sheets (or sheets with similar amounts of information) which is great.

These are the expectations that I have for you as a player. If this does not seem like too much to you, this would be the game for you. However, if these expectations are a problem at the table for you, we can have a discussion about it to find a solution that is fair to both of us.

For those who have read and agree to fulfil the expectations to the best of their ability, send me (No Name) a üê∏ in DMs. You do not have to fill out the forms before sending the üê∏. There is no set deadline for this yet, though that is subject to change as the campaign draws closer.

## Nation-Specific Languages:

Each nation mainly has one nation-specific language, with the rest being shared between the nations due to the ebb and flow of culture and ancestries shifting around the continent of Makoni. Common is shared between them, created by Gibembo during the [Second Chaos Insurgency](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VqxLVrkEks-fL2VqeaT06cmBAB970j97__SDgYyGh5s/edit#heading=h.372gyep2c9y1) due to the need for universal communication between humans, with the nation-specific languages slowly being created by the cultures of each kingdom diverging from one another. If you were to live in these places, you would get this language for free (do not have to replace currently known languages).

  

T√≠r Dh√∫chais: Drayocht; Iontaith (Divided Coast Specific)

Arkhibiil: Cublatun

√Årfer√∞ (Kila): Tunga (Native Kilans speak Sylvan or Elvish)

### Geography:

- The continental archipelago to the left is called Makoni. This encompasses Arkhibiil, in the southern regions of Balter, T√≠r Dh√∫chais (referred to in short form as simply Dh√∫chais) in the northern regions of Keysal, and √Årfer√∞ in the western regions referred to as Kali by the native tribes of Lacerta and Kassini.
    

- √Årfer√∞ got its name from the leader of the deserting army of T√≠r Dh√∫chais, though a majority of the nation calls it Kali. Only those outside of the nation use the new title.
    
- This continent is split up by the Cerulean Depths, and gets its name from the root word for the common word for Head, signifying that this is the head of Gal√°nta (See: First Chaos Insurgency)
    

### History:

#### First Chaos Insurgency (> 1300 Years Ago):

- It is unknown why the first Chaos Insurgency took place, considering the battle started before the planet's land formed. Before then, the two brothers, Decathect and Providence, fought in a vicious battle with their armies. This duel broke through the great void of the universe, splintering and cracking the veil of darkness to form stars.
- At the pinnacle of this war, the armies fell on the celestial bodies littered around the universe, with the corpse of a deity named Gal√°nta upon this planet to form the land.
- It was also at this time that Providence prevailed, banishing Decathect‚Äôs body upon the pale moon that orbits farthest from the planet of Gal√°nta. This banishment was so profound and intense that the moon ruptured into segments, forcing Providence to keep them together by growing a tree in the core of Decathect‚Äôs prison, the branches extending and latching onto the broken pieces.
- This tree was not able to retain all the pieces, and so parts of the lunar body scattered upon Gal√°nta cursed with Decathect‚Äôs power.
- Providence sits upon the rusted moon closer to Gal√°nta‚Äôs body to protect the life that has grown on the planet during this battle.  

#### Second Chaos Insurgency (>= 917 Years Ago):

- Aw shit, here we go again
- The pieces of Decathects‚Äô moon that scattered upon Gal√°nta‚Äôs surface had evolved, corrupting the creatures of the world and enticing them with intelligence far beyond what the norm of the time. These creatures went on murderous rampages, slaughtering those that were not burdened with this power and marring the land. To this day, there are still pieces of land scarred by the power of Decathect‚Äôs corruption.
- Providence, as a means to combat those that mean to destroy what he loves, gave divinity to the select few creatures that had faced this corruption and resisted its allure. This gift birthed the [[03. Deities of Gal√°nta/Major Deities/√ödar√°/√ödar√°\|√ödar√°]], who went on to grant sentience to creatures to create an army large enough to fight against Decathect‚Äôs forces, bringing in the existence of the T√≠r Dh√∫chais and Arkhibiil. Some people say this happened in Relair, the capital of T√≠r Dh√∫chais, whilst others believe this occurred in the centre of the Cerulean Depths, causing the rift between the lands.
- The forces fought together against Decathect‚Äôs Army, scarring the terrain into what would slowly become the Roaming Badlands
- Slowly but surely, the [[03. Deities of Gal√°nta/Major Deities/√ödar√°/√ödar√°\|√ödar√°]], with the help of the forces of man, fought the forces of Decathect back into the Void, preventing their scheme to bring back the Outer God.
- Sealed again, those that had died in this Chaos Insurgency had joined Providences‚Äô protection of the world on the red moon, gaining the name of the Rusted Soldiers.

#### Abstraction (= ~170 Years Ago):
- With the danger that magic poses outside of that ordained by the Abbot of the Stars, a danger that seems more and more prevalent with the mastications (the official term for the string of murders in which the bodies were contorted and twisted to wring the blood from their body) the warlock Xonim committed, sorcerers were unjustly blamed for many problems Relair was facing. Soon, the Abbot called for a hunt, culling the Sorcerers of Dh√∫chais out to prevent any more murders from happening. They were all killed, a portion of them escaping via the ocean or via the Roaming Badlands (or even through the Rikebo Sierra).

#### Pre-Schism (> 9 Years Ago):
- The geographical and arcane growth of T√≠r Dh√∫chais had escalated with Prime Speaker Ymir Dh√∫chais‚Äô rise to power. The Keyni Fields and Rikebo Sierras, once separate from the main Kingdom of Dh√∫chais, had become absorbed and unified under the banner of the bellicose despot.

#### The Schism (>= 9 Years Ago):
- Arkhibiil, wishing to separate itself from the unified banner of Dh√∫chais, had made it clear that they were their own individual Kingdom, which caused the Prime Speaker Ymir to fly into a fit of rage.
- Using the guise of an Arkhibiilan spy found in their walls, Ymir leaped straight into a war, which was devastating to the northern parts of Arkhibiil but fortunately did not reach the capital.
- The king was dangerous, ruthless yet calculating in his approach to the war, even going so far as to start the foundation of the Airship (spearheaded by¬†Mavis Deidritch and the scientists of Asroka)
- Mobilising his fleet was difficult, considering the marred landscape that had split the two kingdoms. This concern did not worry Ymir, who scoffed at the dangers of the Roaming Badlands and forced his army to march on, led by his first daughter Carina Dh√∫chais. The revisit of the Roaming Badlands only enforced the hazards and laid the foundation for its reputation, leading to a resounding defeat due to the reckless nature of their king.
	- This defeat was preceded by a battle between the beasts of the Roaming Badlands, the army of Arkhibiil, and a single Marr Scharfrichter, who defended their comrades as they escaped in the battle of the Perigidin Gates. It was thought that Marr had died, only to resurface heavily injured. This is where she received her title as Hero of Dh√∫chais.
- The new strategy of attacking by sea was a resounding success, thanks to the introduction of Dh√∫chais‚Äô new automaton army. They had taken over Al Hudud in a horrifying manner, murdering all that were on the island.
	- This would not be the last time they would be used in the war, but this would be the most memorable.
- This defeat, as well as the uncaring disposition of their father, caused [[02. Gal√°nta/Makoni/Kila/√Årfer√∞/Notable People (√Årfer√∞)/Calypso Theodoric Dh√∫chais\|Calypso Theodoric Dh√∫chais]] to desert Dh√∫chais in search of a new beginning. She was followed in support by the entire army of Dh√∫chais, who had fled to Kila (known by the [[02. Gal√°nta/Makoni/Keysal/Kingdom of T√≠r Dh√∫chais/Kingdom of T√≠r Dh√∫chais\|Kingdom of T√≠r Dh√∫chais]] as [[02. Gal√°nta/Makoni/Kila/√Årfer√∞/√Årfer√∞\|√Årfer√∞]].
	- This did not stop Ymir‚Äôs advances. His new metallic military was finished, and if not for the Prime Speaker‚Äôs beheading by his second daughter, [[02. Gal√°nta/Makoni/Keysal/Kingdom of T√≠r Dh√∫chais/People/Roundtable/Aria Osric Dh√∫chais\|Aria Osric Dh√∫chais]], the war would have continued before mistakes could be rectified.
- Aria Osric Dh√∫chais went on to end the war and instate the Round Table, a collection of specialists to control different sectors of T√≠r Dh√∫chais‚Äô government, to prevent a needless war from happening again.
- Sultan Corvus of Arkhibiil, with the help of Aria Osric Dh√∫chais, is now fixing the damages caused by Ymir‚Äôs power-hungry actions
- Queen [[02. Gal√°nta/Makoni/Kila/√Årfer√∞/Notable People (√Årfer√∞)/Calypso Theodoric Dh√∫chais\|Calypso Theodoric Dh√∫chais]] of √Årfer√∞ has brokered a peace between the tense tribes of Kassini and Lacerta.

## Q&A:

### Question: How does Magic work in this world?

Answer: The secret to magic is simply the secret of astronomy, being able to discern patterns in the stars and weave magic using these patterns as a guide.

  

It is similar to the pool of magic that Forgotten Realms has, with ley lines naturally bridging the gap between the subtle source of magic and the concrete, applied force that moves mountains. Ley lines are actually channels where magic power flows like an invisible river across the landscape. But the source is hotly debated; People believe it to be a reservoir of power from the battle of Providence and Decathect, whereas others believe it is the mere existence of Gibembo that acts as a battery for humans, or even as a gift from Wikefi (though whether that gift was intentional or she just uncovered something else that gave magic to the people accidentally is unsure. She's a very investigative person, wanting to uncover the truth no matter what). People believe that if they uncover the truth about the movements of the stars, they will find the source of magic.

  

The main problem with this, and why it's so hotly debated, is that people have been observed getting magic from other areas. And I don't mean Sorcerers, but wizards using some... other things, to cast arcane magic. A famous example would be Blood Magic.

  

For example, a very famous magician was sacrificing people to cast blood magic. Cutting people open, killing people, draining them of blood, all to cast magic. He was quickly beheaded, but a problem arose from this magician: If we use the power of the stars, and those beyond, to cast magic, does that mean a creature from beyond the stars is taking blood magic's sacrifices? Is there something that subsists in humans beyond that which we can see?

### Question: What are the feywild/shadowfell/etc equivalents, if any exist yet?
