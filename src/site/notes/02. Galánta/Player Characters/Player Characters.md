The known information on the player characters will be placed here and updated as regularly as I can. This is a section I do encourage people try and contribute to for their own characters, but once again it is not mandatory. Each page will have a section to allow the players (you) to add notes on your or your characters' thoughts on that character, labelled under Other Player's Notes.

Each page will be formatted as the template below. It may not be filled with information in the beginning, and information may change throughout the campaign.

An example can be found at [[02. Gal√°nta/Player Characters/Example Character (Wilson)\|Example Character (Wilson)]]
