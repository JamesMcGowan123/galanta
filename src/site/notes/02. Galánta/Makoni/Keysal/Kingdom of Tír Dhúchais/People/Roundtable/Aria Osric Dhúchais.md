# The Prime Speaker
(They/Them)

The Prime Speaker of the Kingdom of Dhúchais, Aria is currently the only person that can possibly lead the throne within the Dhúchais line due to her sister, [[02. Galánta/Makoni/Kila/Árferð/Notable People (Árferð)/Calypso Theodoric Dhúchais\|Calypso Theodoric Dhúchais]], defecting to create Árferð. She will take no insults to the [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Údará/Údará\|Údará]], especially [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Údará/Providence\|Providence]], as the main deity of her family and even the emblem for her family. Very little else is known other than her piety and her dedication to the crown.

Aria Dhúchais' face is mainly hidden by a black silk veil headband, held together by a steel rim that surrounds her head. Only her mouth is visible through the veil, with the rest of her body being covered in black armour of an ornate design, with the two moons revolving around the planet of Galánta upon their chest plate.
