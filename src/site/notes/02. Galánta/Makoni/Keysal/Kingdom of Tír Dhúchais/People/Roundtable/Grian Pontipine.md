# Abbot of the Stars
(He/Him)

Speaker for the Arcane and the ways of Wizards, Grian Pontipine stands at the pinnacle of his craft. Long has it been since another has broken the ceiling of the higher tiers of arcana, and longer still has it been that another were to have relations with the land of the Fey. With his understanding of the [[Astral Current\|Astral Current]] and the laws that bind [[Limbo\|Limbo]], communication with other planes has been made possible. He is very popular with the students of the [[Galánta/Makoni/Keysal/Kingdom of Tír Dhúchais/Countries (Dhúchais)/Keyni Fields/Relair/Starlight Consortium\|Starlight Consortium]], especially due to the arcane shows he puts on and the lessons he teaches in the rare moments he can.
