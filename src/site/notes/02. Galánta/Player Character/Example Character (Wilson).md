- Class: Barbarian 2
- Species: [Grung](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/lineage:grung)

## Motivations:
- Getting rid of the potion of intelligence placed upon him
- Showing off his strength at the Field of Triumph
- (NEW) Perhaps reconnecting/learning about his family?

## Physical Description:
Wilson is a spotted Grung whose colour shifts from gold to blue with its body, similar to that of a Dyeing Dart Frog, with black patterns dotted throughout the back of their body. Wearing a woollen skirt, a sturdy belt, and a hooded cloak very not fit for the somewhat beefy toad that Wilson is. A slightly corroded lance sits upon their back, accompanied by a much cleaner javelin in a cross. Hidden not so well beneath the tight cloak is a mace that has not seen much use at all. The Grung’s patterns make it so a black curly mustache (which transforms into a pair of flexing arms when raging).

## Relationships:
### Anderson “Something Something” Something
Anderson is the alchemist that had perhaps created the potion of intelligence or maybe stole it and was smuggling it away, Anderson hired Widdles to take care of the potion and take it to the docks, hidden amongst boxes and boxes of miscellaneous trinkets and baubles. Anderson now searches for Widdles for compensation or maybe to study the effects of an item he created/stole.

Obviously, “Something Something” is not an actual nickname, nor is Something their last name. Widdles just can’t remember much past the last name. Wilson, for fear of exploding their mind, tries not to remember.

### Indigo “Igglepiggle” Poltin
Igglepiggle, real name Indigo Poltin, was a middleman for Widdles, taking some of the cut for providing jobs for the Grung. Now, you may ask, why he needed a middleman when a quest board would be readily available. BROTHER CAN’T READ, or at least couldn’t. An older lady, she took advantage of Widdles financially, but at least was somewhat nice about it, feeding Widdles and giving him a place to stay.

Igglepiggle was actually a nickname given to her by her daughter, who had grown older and had become an adventurer outside of Waterdeep. They have not really kept in contact, for reasons unknown to Widdles, but it’s obvious in the way that Indigo had kept her room the exact same that she really cares for her daughter.

### Kresh “The Cobra”
Kresh plays the heel to Wilson’s “El Grungé”, presented as a cruel natural predator of the wrestler, and in fact having a similar shoot style to Wilson, though more focused on chaining grapples together to methodically break the body of their opponents “like a snake coiling around its prey”.

Kresh, whilst called a Cobra, is actually a black Dragonborn with patterns painted upon their body to look similar to that of a King Cobra (imagine Arbok’s face patterns or whatnot). Furthermore, outside of combat, Kresh is a genuinely cool person, though is known to take a bit/joke slightly too far. He was the person who introduced Widdles into wrestling before Igglepiggle picked him up, and he was also the person who helped shape the character of El Grungé into the paragon of virtue he is today.

When he does not have a match, Kresh is a florist, which plays into the Cobra’s character of being a cool guy in general, but naturally hating El Grungé. He brings flowers as part of his intro, passing them out to spectators. When he first went to hand one to Widdles, Kresh actually ate it in front of him and hit him with an underhanded move, starting the career as a heel.

## Other Player's Notes:
### Amanda's Notes:
- *"You are completely clueless, but you seem mostly well-intentioned. I'll teach you to take charge of your career in showmanship if you stop making me confront my familial issues in public. Fair deal?"*

### Leah's Notes:
- *"El Grunge, the famous fighter of Waterdeep's colosseum. I believe I administered aid to this fighter during a skirmish. It is fortunate that we have such a capable bodyguard for Lady Fixes. He seems polite and well-spoken enough; he must rub elbows with many a noble."*

### Max's Notes:
- *"He's an interesting guy, and I admire his strength. I would like to see him in the arena, and maybe have a proper spar sometime. I wonder if he's ever thinking about anything other than fighting sometimes..."*
