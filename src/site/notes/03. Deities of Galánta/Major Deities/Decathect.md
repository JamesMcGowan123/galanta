#Deity #Major_Deity 
*The Traitor*

Brother of [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Údará/Providence\|Providence]], Limund was cast out due to their disrespect of nature and his brazen fiddling with entities beyond their power (The Void).

## Weather Phenomenon of the Shattered Moon, Decathect
Due to the awesome clash between fraternal deities, the traitor God known as Decathect has been imprisoned upon the shattered moon, taking the name of this traitor so that all who look up to the night sky can see what happens to those that threaten those who live under the banner of [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Údará/Providence\|Providence]]. The large chunks of this divided prison moon is kept together by wooden roots of a tree, but the smaller pieces orbiting about the broken celestial's body, creating a disk that is believed to act as another shackle for Decathect's prison.

When the moon reaches its zenith, these smaller pieces of the shattered moon rain upon the land. Those found under the moon without the protection of a deity or under the safety of hearth and home will be targeted, their life force absorbed as the deity attempts to mend its wounds. Furthermore, the magic of the shattered pieces distorts the astral currents of [[02. Galánta/02. Galánta\|Galánta]], nullifying or even dispelling spells of 5th level or lower upon contact, ending concentration on spells, and halving the range of all magics cast as the lunar shower continues.

Very little is left of these showers, as these pieces are not large enough to survive the journey to [[02. Galánta/02. Galánta\|Galánta]]. However, strange rumours have circulated from the villages across the [[02. Galánta/Makoni/Keysal/Kingdom of Tír Dhúchais/Kingdom of Tír Dhúchais\|Kingdom of Tír Dhúchais]] and [[02. Galánta/Makoni/Balter/Arkhibiil/Arkhibiil\|Arkhibiil]] of pieces of Decathect that hold the power of the void above ([[Limbo\|Limbo]]). Those beckoned by its power, man or creature, are enveloped in the frost of the void above, given inhuman form and abilities far beyond mortal limits. Though these rumours are separate and different from one another, they seem to share one trait to its origins: That the monster appears after a member of their people has been exiled.

The primary way of dealing with these monsters is said to not exile at all. Many villages that do not practice exile have reported no such monster (though there are exceptions). However, if such a monster is currently terrorising villages, villagers tell that burning the house of those who were exiled is the only way to get rid of them, as they lose their attachments to the village and the world. It is unknown when this story was first told, though it has been found in sources up to 400 years old, in a compendium originating in [[02. Galánta/Makoni/Balter/Arkhibiil/Arkhibiil\|Arkhibiil]] translating roughly to "Talib's Adventures".
