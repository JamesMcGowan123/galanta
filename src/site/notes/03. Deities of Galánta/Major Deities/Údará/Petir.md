# Petir
*The Grey Lady*

Petir is the product of [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Údará/Komida\|Komida]]'s tumultuous union. It is said that during one of their spats, both partners were fraught with emotion and weeping. When they came to terms and pressed their foreheads to one another, their closeness called their tears to fall together. The largest of these combined teardrops swelled with life, and was named for the sound that she made when she landed on the ground as rain, "Petir".

As Petir grew, they bore witness to the squabbling of their parents and began to learn to mediate. Just as rain falling on the surface of the earth filled rivers, extinguished painful burns, fed [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Údará/Komida\|Komida]]'s crops, and cooled the air -- Petir too became a presence for peace.

Born during the [[Second Chaos Insurgency\|Second Chaos Insurgency]], Petir witnessed a world at war from the moment they were born. A being hewn discord and remediation themselves, they were unable to bear the continual combat on [[02. Galánta/Galánta\|Galánta]], which they saw as completely senseless. Unable to lift a hand to fight for the peace they desired, and also unable to successfully mediate the conflict, they carved out a place of their own where the weary and beaten could find rest without interruption. This place existed parallel to the conscious world, a place where sleep could be unperturbed, and is referred to as the Rainlands -- an endless, foggy forest of pines, where the wandering souls of all things are welcome to find respite. It is said that in the Rainlands, the beds are warm and dry, and the roof never leaks. It is host to wanderers and endless sleepers of all walks, fungal, floral, fauna, humanoid, and monstrous.

Those grieving the dead commonly find solace in the first rain after a passing. Sweat and tears are lost in the endless pitter-patter of rain. The veil between the walking-waking and endlessly slumbering is thinnest here when the air hangs thick with petrichor, and Petir grieves alongside you.

They are the patron of poets, diplomats, and the weary. It is said that Petir gave the canines of [[02. Galánta/Galánta\|Galánta]] the sense to detect sadness in the hearts of people so that they could come to comfort them.
