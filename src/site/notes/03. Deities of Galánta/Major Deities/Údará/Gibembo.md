#Deity #Major_Deity #Udara 

- Old traveller, spreading the stories of the stars to those that cross his paths amongst the winding roads of [[02. Galánta/Galánta\|Galánta]].
- Usually seen at night, when the stars are in full force (or if certain weather conditions take place), and known for a wizened voice that will bring fortune to those that study magic. (maybe granting an extra spell concerning the story told/extra prepared spell)

*"(She) has eyes like the yawning void above. Many stories to tell, absolutely delighted the children! Even got my daughter to study for once in her life, now she's on the track to study at the academy!... You're lookin' for her? She wenta that way, but she never said anythin' about a destination."*
- An account from a farmer taken from a 600 years ago, taken from a theologian under [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Údará/Wikefi\|Wikefi]]. No woman was seen in the villages pointed by the farmer, though it is noted that an old man had come through. The man had left a walking cane for the theologian, later identified as an incredible artefact which now rests within the [[Starlight Consortium\|Starlight Consortium]].

Does [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Údará/Wikefi\|Wikefi]] understand the nature of the stars above? Does [[03. Deities of Galánta/Minor Deities/Rofi\|Rofi]] know the meaning behind each light that fills the sea they sail? Some say they are naught but remnants of the [[First Chaos Insurgency\|First Chaos Insurgency]]; damage done to the void above. Others take them as secrets, taken and ripped open so that their potential and knowledge can be laid bare. Followers of Gibembo understand them to be teachers, leading to understanding the self through understanding the stars. Each star tells a story, after all, and it is Gibembo's great pleasure to regale the children of [[02. Galánta/Galánta\|Galánta]] with the stories told by the stars.

Gibembo has no defined appearance other than that of an old person with eyes that resemble [[Limbo\|Limbo]], the void above, and a gnarled wooden staff. The stories say that they often stop by taverns or wayward travellers during late hours, hoping for a meal but with only a story in trade. Those that accept the deal are treated kindly to as many stories as they could handle, and find themselves awaking to a boon. Though never specified, they often tell of auspicious fortune. One such fortune comes in the discovery of the [[Astral Current\|Astral Current]] and its manipulation of the forms of magic throughout [[02. Galánta/Galánta\|Galánta]] and beyond, with the star's position and luminosity acting as a guide as to the locations with strong flows.

Gibembo's teachings now make up a large section of the arcane understandings of the [[Starlight Consortium\|Starlight Consortium]] in [[Relair\|Relair]], with the constellations found by the followers of Gibembo acting as the foundation for magic spells cast by arcane practitioners. Many theologians under both [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Údará/Wikefi\|Wikefi]] and Gibembo's banner spend many hours trying to uncover the stories hidden within the stars without much luck, given that the last spell uncovered just under 150 years ago.
