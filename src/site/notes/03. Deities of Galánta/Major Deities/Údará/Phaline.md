*The Forgotten Primogenitor*

Many tales tell of the greatness of [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Decathect\|Decathect]] and [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Údará/Providence\|Providence]]’s battles across the ages, and how they landed upon the barren soil of [[02. Galánta/Galánta\|Galánta]]. But few tell tales of that which came before, and the fury of those who’s ocean was disturbed by the children that fought at her doorstep. But the ocean never forgets, and neither does Phaline.

Depictions of Phaline vary wildly, from a creature resembling a mermaid to one that keeps no form, that cannot be defined by the constructs we mortals can grasp, for who can grasp a creature that has lived long before us and will live long after the heartiest can perish. The only consistent feature seems to be the numerous eyes upon her body. Eyes all across her body, eyes that watch her children swim throughout [[02. Galánta/Galánta\|Galánta]], unceasing in their burning gaze on the lookout for intruders that would sully her pristine ocean. This is actually the main reason many ships decorate the hull and keel to represent denizens of the sea from various mythos, in hopes for safe passage across the oceans.

The existence of Phaline was first found in ruins of civilisations near the islands off the coast of [[02. Galánta/Makoni/Balter/Arkhibiil/Arkhibiil\|Arkhibiil]], its existence told by the myths of sailors before this discovery. Many of the warnings that sailors spout are of the eyes below the somewhat infamous Gazing Depths, though many of them also share the thread of irregular creatures swimming past, luring those that were to sail past to their doom. Many of the people in the main cities dismiss it as mere hysteria, though the sailors swear by it.

There is a belief that Phaline is the half of [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Údará/Komida\|Komida]] that leaves during the winter times, given how she rules over the waters that give nutrients to the lands. However, the Abbot of the Stars vehemently fights against this belief. Many of the younger children joke within the Academy Arcanum that the Abbot is homophobic and hates lesbians, which has led Phaline to become sort of a patron for young, closeted teens and adults within the Academy and beyond.
