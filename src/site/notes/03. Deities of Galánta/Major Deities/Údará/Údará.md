#Udara 
The Údará are the main pantheon of the [[02. Galánta/Makoni/Keysal/Kingdom of Tír Dhúchais/Kingdom of Tír Dhúchais\|Kingdom of Tír Dhúchais]], the protectors of humanity who stood up against the scourge of [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Decathect\|Decathect]]. These are seen as the morally pure deities, that represent aspects of life that all humans should strive to achieve. Though it is rarely seen in the scriptures and texts that follow this group them interacting much outside of the [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Údará/Providence\|Providence]]'s presence being suggested, the interactions they do have seem to imply stories in which stories following more innocuous adventures. We have not yet translated newer scriptures, and are unsure if they tell of these stories.
