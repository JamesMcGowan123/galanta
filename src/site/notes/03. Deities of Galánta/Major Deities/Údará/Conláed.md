# Conláed
*Righteous Candescence*

Depending on who is asked, Conláed is either the patron-champion of the mistreated and wronged, or a cautionary tale -- a warning against the consumptive power of anger. One thing remains true in either case; Conláed is the entity that exists where despondence catches fire and explodes into action.

They are the god of fire, especially wildfires and volcanism. The duality of fire is one that they share, and Conláed is a controversial deity for this reason. Fire can warm the weary hands of the lost and frightened, just as it can immolate and destroy. Conláed, too, is volatile. They are a being of passion first and of reason second. This deity is associated with many different folks, from brave and noble justiciars to the wounded and vengeful. The wisest among their worshippers know that the strength shared by Conláed’s fire is one to be taken carefully -- the passion of the flame can be fed too quickly, taken by the wind. When hurt and hate are given too much fuel, even fair and noble pursuits can leave the world scorched to ash. This is the thesis of Conláed, as they exist in the heart of the home and the destruction of a pyroclastic flow. That which Conláed’s followers see as wrong must be undone, by fury and heat.

Conláed is depicted as a haggard, burning, naked human of indeterminate gender, skewered through the heart by a white-hot fire iron. They are often illustrated as a face of flames within a hearth, or a figure emerging from a brushfire.
