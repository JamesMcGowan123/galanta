*The Drunken Snake*

*"His hands bathed in molten glim, no smile grew larger, or shook the earth more than Besyr's."*
- An excerpt from the Clashes, originally released in 231 PI. This quote is from a translated version of the Clashes, released in 572 PI

The youngest of the Gods, born as the [[01. Hub/Timeline/Vertical/Second Chaos Insurgency\|Second Chaos Insurgency]] was won by the [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Údará/Údará\|Údará]], Besyr was created from the collective joy and revelry mortals and Gods alike felt. His fervour and jubilance had the world partying for 3 days and 3 nights, not stopping for a single moment until all had collapsed from exhaustion and [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Údará/Providence\|Providence]] had left for his post. Still, Besyr celebrates forever more, spreading the joy and excitement of life wherever he goes.

Previously sanctioned as a deity for worship by previous religious officials, the deity has now fallen out of the [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Údará/Údará\|Údará]], due to the rise in popularity that his more... mischievous side had gotten. However, this rise was caused by the blatant disrespect of zealots. Using Besyr's name as an excuse, ministers would embezzle the donations of the churches and squander the money of the working man in order to "fully realise Besyr's teachings", meaning drink and dine with ill-gotten gains. This "meditation" caused an uprising of theft, pillaging the hoarded wealth of the church to return back to the people. This clash between the churches and the people had gone on for months until the Prime Speaker had outlawed the deity's worship all-together.

With Besyr's merriment as a guide, the largest criminal faction was created. Organisations that deal in all sorts of illegal activities have existed for many, many years, going back to the Chaos Insurgencies. However, the Blind Robbings (the unofficial name for the feud between the church of Besyr and the people) was considered the first time these various organisations came together to score a large bounty, and they just seemed to have absorbed one another into a great criminal partnership.
