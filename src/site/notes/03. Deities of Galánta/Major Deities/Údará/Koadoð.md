#Deity #Major_Deity #Udara 
*The Prisoner*

Chains sprawling across the planes, across time, each intersecting at the crux of the planet with one singular purpose; to seal Koadođ away. The eldest of the deities, bar [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Údará/Providence\|Providence]] and one other, Koadođ is the only deity worshipped that was created by Limund, from the wealth of the brothers. However, he was born with inherent fealty towards [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Údará/Providence\|Providence]]. Created before the wars, to show [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Údará/Providence\|Providence]] how to create other beings. Thus, Koadođ served on [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Údará/Providence\|Providence]]’s side. Koadođ’s power was great, perhaps great enough to defeat Limund’s forces single-handedly, but the cost would have been too great. Quickly, [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Údará/Providence\|Providence]] sealed Koadođ away within the core of [[02. Galánta/Galánta\|Galánta]] and sent those that would do more harm than good to the Rusted Soldiers to his side.

Though sealed away, Koadoð still has a great love for [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Údará/Providence\|Providence]], acting on his behalf as the warden for the underworld known as [[Awateki\|Awateki]], believing that he will be given his righteous place alongside his creator as a protector of [[02. Galánta/Galánta\|Galánta]]. And so he waits, punishing the sinners of the pantheon’s chief, awaiting his return to the light so that he may enact the death that [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Údará/Providence\|Providence]] would never provide for Limund. Now, Koadoð represents wealth, fealty, and death.

People pray to Koadoð to absolve themselves of their sins, breaking the chains of their past obsessions and being renewed as they pass these chains upon Koadoð.
