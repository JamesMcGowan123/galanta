*The Gatherer*

Originally thought to be one deity, Komida is actually the culmination of love between two gods becoming one. This god of agriculture is a patron of grapes, wine, healing, and more esoteric arts like alchemy, acting as the narrator in many of the stories we have of the [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Údará/Údará\|Údará]]. They are fickle beings, with their marital spats changing the season. When they are together, the seasons bring warmth to the land, growing the crops and feeding all. However, they are a very dramatic couple, with the first documented use of “make a mountain out of a molehill” being in their story, and as the wife leaves to tend to her garden in the void above, the husband grows colder and sadder. The story ends with the husband calling the wife back, and spring erupting from their love once again. The names of the two of lost to time, but their love will forever be immortalised in the name of Komida

This rebirth of love is celebrated at the end of winter with the Dawning's Veil Festival, a celebration of love and family, as well as a welcoming back to the summertime and harvest.
