*The Crone*

Though mainly prayed to by young wizards desperately aiming to pass an exam, or those seeking information, Wikefi is the deity of discovery and creativity in all its forms. An advocate for information gained more through experience than academic research, they act as a guide and guardian for trans people within the lands of Dhúchais. Perhaps due to this epithet, or perhaps due to the lack of texts surrounding them, there is a lack of description of their appearance, instead being described as a hand reaching out from behind a door or around a corner, helping the faithful to information they are looking for.

Offerings to Wikefi usually consist of scrolls of information, ledgers, and tales of discovery (internal or otherwise), as a sort of trade or boon. Wikefi is also the patron of Inquisitors, who believe their light will shine upon the truth. Though they have many patrons throughout the kingdoms, their main cluster comes from the Sidus Sophós, a faction within the western reaches of Dhúchais.
