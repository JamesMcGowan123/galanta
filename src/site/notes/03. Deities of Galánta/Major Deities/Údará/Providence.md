*The Stalwart Defender*

	“Why must we fight?! Why must you pain me so, to force your head down below the ants and vermin of the world, when we are made to look up?!”
	“...” Providence’s words shake through the earth, ripples of sand dancing to their voice.
	Limund’s sword picks up once more in response to his brother’s answer, before the betrayer says, “... You speak as a child dreams.”

- An excerpt from the Clashes, depicting a conversation between Limund and Providence, originally released in 231 PI. This quote, along with its page, remain one of the only pages fully recoverable in ancient Drayocht.
- Scholars and zealots believe Providence to have given an answer defending mankind, [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Decathect\|Decathect]]'s question referring to us as “ants and vermin'' (this is debated to mean literally, that Providence uses his strength to protect any and all creatures of [[Galánta\|Galánta]], rather than just humanity). Providence’s silence may refer to the fact that we cannot interpret his words, or properly convey them. It is also possible that Providence as a concept disgusts Limund, the former representing the strength and tenacity of the “ants and vermin'' he seems to despise.

Providence, the leader of the victors of the Chaos Insurgency. Brother to Limund. Contrary to leaders of other pantheons, such as Norse or Greek, he had no blood relations to any other praised in the [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Údará/Údará\|Údará]]. Nor did he attempt to sway them to his side. Providence fights to protect those under his creation, under his banner, no matter the odds. He is the God of Justice, the Patron Saint of the Poor and Misfortunate. He does not force others under his banner but will take any who wish. Within any texts or scriptures, there are no known records of Providence speaking, though many have been known to talk to or at him. It is not as though the leader does not speak, simply that his words are not conveyed through the texts and teachings of the Clashes. Though much outside of the main story is officially lost, it is shown that his great feats of strength and kindness persuade those to join him against his brother.

Though Providence is noted to not originate from [[Galánta\|Galánta]], and is in fact hinted at existing before the planet had, the deity’s appearance is reminiscent of the natural landscape of Tír Dhúchais. His clothes are covered in dirt and ivy, his cape ripped and tattered, his crown splintering off in jagged shapes like the valleys and mountains of Dhúchais. Providence’s actual body, however, would be described simply as void, with no notable features other than a bright blue point that splinters off like a stationary compass rose. The only odd part would be that his helmet seems to be covered in gems, underneath the dirt and ivy, veins of bright blue gemstones lining themselves around the outline of his semi-circular helm.

Prayer to Providence persists mainly in good deeds. To help those less fortunate than oneself, to dedicate time to providing for others as you would your family, to give selflessly in his name, these supersede any prayer that would occur in an ordained temple; not that they do not exist.
