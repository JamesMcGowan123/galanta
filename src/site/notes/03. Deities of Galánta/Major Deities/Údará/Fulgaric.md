*The Cloud Strider*
******
*"Her talons wring the clouds, water dripping to the lands below as she pulls her weight forward. The sky follows her strength, the winds rushing past."* 
- An excerpt from the Clashes, originally released in 231 PI. Though this quote is from a translated version of the Clashes, it retains its original structure, and has actually led to the partial translation of the language of Draythe, and older form of the modern Drayocht

Fulgaric is to the sky that [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Údará/Phaline\|Phaline]] is to the waters; An unknowable force that guides the winds, too ancient to be understood by mortal ken, much older than that of [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Údará/Providence\|Providence]] and [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Decathect\|Decathect]]. Scriptures note her as the original protector of these lands before [[02. Galánta/Galánta\|Galánta]]'s body had given life to it, a role she still adamantly fulfils to this day.

Though her form - a scaly, lithe body reminiscent of a snake with the exception of four limbs, two arms and legs, as well as a flowing cloud that seems to gently float around her neck and luscious mane - seems to suggest a relationship with the forces of nature that are Dragons, there do not seem to be any written connections to the creatures, and instead imply a more parental connection with that of Wyverns (What 5e would normally consider a dragon).

Within the Clashes, Fulgaric has been shown to be a rather capricious, her attempts at enigma falling flat upon [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Údará/Providence\|Providence]] and quickly growing agitated because of it. Furthermore, it seems they are on bad terms with [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Údará/Phaline\|Phaline]], [[Fulgaric's Deterrent\|Fulgaric's Deterrent]] (the lands that house the Verdant Coasts and the Sailor's Panoply) being a sign of that with the tall glass statues, like lightning had met the sand and heated it around the bolt's form. It is stated that these statues, called statues of wrath, are remnants of a battle against [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Údará/Phaline\|Phaline]]'s attempts to breach the surface. Though it is unknown as to why Fulgaric would go to this length, it lends itself to the cloud strider's other moniker -  the ancient determination.

People's worship of this deity mainly occurs if they need the strength to achieve something of their own strength. Unlike [[03. Deities of Galánta/Major Deities/Údará/Providence\|Providence]]'s focus on helping others, Fulgaric is a proud deity that does not depend on waiting for another. Those who follow her are mainly athletes, soldiers, or those who fall under labour intensive duties.

Interestingly enough, though she is noted as a woman in the original texts, her name uses a suffix to mean "son of", or the male version of "to be born under".
